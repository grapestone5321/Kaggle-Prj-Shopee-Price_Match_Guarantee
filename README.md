## Task

In this competition, you’ll apply your machine learning skills to build a model that predicts which items are the same products.

-------

## Evaluation

Submissions will be evaluated based on their mean F1 score. 

The mean is calculated in a sample-wise fashion, meaning that an F1 score is calculated for every predicted row, then averaged.


### F1 score

              n = len( np.intersect1d(row.target,row[col]) )
              return 2*n / (len(row.target)+len(row[col]))
          return f1score
